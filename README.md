# streamerCalendar
Public Port of HoloCal, in a modifiable config for every streamer

This is in a super-beta stage where I am reaching out to VTubers and taking inputs from them to modify this template.
_I advise not to use it in its current form_, as things are still being finalised and edited, along with some performance changes.

If you want to test it out, you can hit me up on Discord: @Sant268#1878

peace <3 (surely I need to make this ReadMe more, **professional** later on)
