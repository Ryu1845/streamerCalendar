# streamerCalendar
Public Port of HoloCal, in a modifiable config for every streamer

This is in a super-beta stage where I am reaching out to VTubers and taking inputs from them to modify this template.
_I advise not to use it in its current form_, as things are still being finalised and edited, along with some performance changes.

If you want to test it out, you can hit me up on Discord: @Sant268#1878

peace <3 (surely I need to make this ReadMe more, **professional** later on) 

In it's current scuffed form, it uses:
- Fullcalendar (not premium) mainly for it's basic organization of the calendar, and Timezone support
- Bootswatch Theme for _Dark Mode_
- A **lot** of JQuery Modification to inject content by manual params
- Google Calendar as a source for Data (Events) Entry
